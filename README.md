- 👋 Hi, I’m @StanAfrica
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding simple basic languages as a hobby
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSX50 on the harvard edux portal
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects in 20 weeks from now once I am more familiar
- 📫 How to reach me if there is a way in GITHUB do so but for now not yet.
